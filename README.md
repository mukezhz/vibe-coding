## Linter setup

Need [Python3](https://www.python.org/) to setup linter in git pre-commit hook.

```zsh
make lint-setup
```

---

## Run application

-   Setup environment variables

```zsh
cp .env.example .env
```

-   Update your database credentials environment variables in `.env` file
-   Update `STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` in `.env` with your AWS S3 bucket name.

### Locally

-   Run `go run main.go app:serve` to start the server.
-   There are other commands available as well. You can run `go run main.go -help` to know about other commands available.

### Using `Docker`

> Ensure Docker is already installed in the machine.

-   Start server using command `docker-compose up -d` or `sudo docker-compose up -d` if there are permission issues.

## üöÄ Running Migrations

This project uses [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/) for database schema migrations. Atlas enables declarative, versioned, and diff-based schema changes.

---

### üß∞ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following set up:

- **Atlas CLI**: Install Atlas by running:

  ```sh
  curl -sSf https://atlasgo.sh | sh
  ```

  > For other installation methods or details, visit the [official installation guide](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started/installation).

- **`.env` file** at the project root with the following environment variables:

  ```env
  DB_USER=root
  DB_PASS=secret
  DB_NAME=exampledb
  DB_FORWARD_PORT=3306
  ```

---

### üì¶ Available Migration Commands

Below are the supported `make` commands for managing database migrations:

| Make Command          | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make migrate-status` | Show the current migration status                                           |
| `make migrate-diff`   | Generate a new migration by comparing models to the current DB (`gorm` env) |
| `make migrate-apply`  | Apply all pending migrations                                                |
| `make migrate-down`   | Roll back the most recent migration (`gorm` env)                            |
| `make migrate-hash`   | Hash migration files for integrity checking                                 |

---

üìö For more on schema management and best practices, refer to the [Atlas documentation](https://atlasgo.io).

## Testing

The framework comes with comprehensive unit and integration testing support out of the box, powered by several modern testing tools:

- **[Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/)**: A BDD-style testing framework
- **[TestContainers](https://testcontainers.com/)**: For isolated, containerized integration testing
- **[Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/)**: For database schema migration testing

For detailed test instructions and examples, see our [testing guide](./.github/instructions/testing.instructions.md).

### Running Tests

To run all tests:

```zsh
go test ./... -v
```

To run tests with coverage using Ginkgo:

```zsh
ginkgo -v --cover -r ./domain/... ./pkg/...
```

### For test coverage report

```zsh
go test ./... -v -coverprofile cover.txt -coverpkg=./...
go tool cover -html=cover.txt -o coverage.html
```

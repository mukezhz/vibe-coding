# Product Context - Go Clean Architecture

## Why This Project Exists
This project exists to provide a standardized, production-ready template for building REST APIs in Go using clean architecture principles. It addresses the common challenges of structuring Go applications by providing a clear separation of concerns, dependency management, and scalable architecture patterns.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Architectural Consistency** - Establishes a clear, organized structure for Go applications that scales with project complexity
2. **Dependency Management** - Implements proper dependency injection with uber-go/fx to avoid tight coupling
3. **Code Organization** - Provides a domain-centric approach to organizing code for better maintainability
4. **Development Efficiency** - Creates reusable patterns for common API features like CRUD operations, authentication, and error handling
5. **Technical Debt Reduction** - Enforces separation of concerns to reduce long-term maintenance issues
6. **Onboarding Simplification** - Makes it easier for new developers to understand the project structure and contribute effectively

## How It Should Work
The application follows a clean architecture pattern with clear layers:
- **Domain Layer** - Core business models and interfaces
- **Repository Layer** - Data access implementation
- **Service Layer** - Business logic
- **Controller Layer** - Request/response handling
- **Route Layer** - API endpoint definitions

Each domain (feature area) follows the same pattern, making the system consistent and predictable. The application is built around modular components that can be easily composed with dependency injection.

## User Experience Goals
For developers using this template, the experience should be:
1. **Intuitive** - Clear folder structure and consistent patterns across domains
2. **Extensible** - Easy to add new domains or features without major refactoring
3. **Discoverable** - Self-documenting code with clear interfaces and dependencies
4. **Maintainable** - Separation of concerns that makes the codebase easy to maintain
5. **Well-Documented** - Proper documentation and examples for common patterns
6. **DevOps Ready** - Docker setup, environment configuration, and deployment patterns included

The application prioritizes developer experience through:
- Clear error messages and logging
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Consistent pattern implementation
- Docker-based development and deployment options
- Database migration and seed data mechanisms
- Testing tools and examples

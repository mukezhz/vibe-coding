# Project Brief - Go Clean Architecture

## Project Overview
This project implements a Go-based clean architecture API service. It follows pragmatic clean architecture principles, focusing on maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns.

## Core Requirements
1. Implement a REST API following clean architecture principles
2. Provide a robust, organized, and scalable codebase structure
3. Enable modular domain-based development
4. Support proper dependency injection
5. Include comprehensive error handling
6. Implement authentication and authorization
7. Support database operations with proper ORM implementation
8. Provide API documentation and testing tools

## Key Goals
1. Create a maintainable and easy-to-understand codebase structure
2. Demonstrate clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns
3. Support multiple domains (user, todo, organization, booking)
4. Implement robust error handling and logging
5. Enable seamless dependency injection
6. Support both local development and Docker-based deployment
7. Provide database migration and seeding capabilities
8. Support AWS services integration (S3, Cognito, SES)

## Project Scope
The application serves as a clean architecture template with the following components:
- Domain-based organization (users, todos, organizations, bookings)
- Infrastructure setup (database, router, AWS integration)
- Middleware support (authentication, rate limiting, etc.)
- CLI command structure
- Environment configuration management
- Database migrations with Atlas
- Standardized error handling and responses
- API documentation with Bruno API client

This project is intended to be a foundation for building scalable and maintainable Go-based APIs with proper architecture and best practices.

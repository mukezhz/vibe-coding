# Progress - Go Clean Architecture

## What Works

### Core Structure
- âœ… Clean architecture implementation with domain-based organization
- âœ… Dependency injection with Uber FX
- âœ… Routing with Gin Web Framework
- âœ… Database integration with GORM
- âœ… Environment configuration with Viper
- âœ… Command structure with Cobra
- âœ… Logging with Zap
- âœ… Error handling and standardized responses

### Domains
- âœ… User domain with basic functionality
- âœ… Todo domain with CRUD operations
- âœ… Organization domain with CRUD operations
- âœ… Booking domain with resource management and scheduling

### Infrastructure
- âœ… Database connection and management
- âœ… Router setup with middleware support
- âœ… AWS S3 integration for file storage
- âœ… AWS Cognito integration for authentication
- âœ… AWS SES integration for email
- âœ… Database migrations with Atlas
- âœ… Docker setup for development

### API Documentation
- âœ… Bruno API client setup for documentation and testing

## What's Left to Build

### Authentication
- ðŸ”„ Complete authentication flows
- ðŸ”„ Role-based access control implementation
- ðŸ”„ Permission management

### Testing
- ðŸ”„ Comprehensive unit tests
- ðŸ”„ Integration tests
- ðŸ”„ API endpoint tests

### Documentation
- ðŸ”„ Detailed API documentation
- ðŸ”„ Developer guide for extending the application
- ðŸ”„ Deployment documentation

### Deployment
- ðŸ”„ CI/CD pipeline setup
- ðŸ”„ Production deployment configuration
- ðŸ”„ Infrastructure as code

### Features
- ðŸ”„ Additional domain-specific features
- ðŸ”„ Advanced query capabilities
- ðŸ”„ Reporting and analytics
- ðŸ”„ Notification system

## Current Status
The application is in a functional state with the core architecture and domains implemented. It serves as a solid foundation for a clean architecture Go application that can be extended with additional features.

The basic CRUD operations for users, todos, organizations, and bookings are implemented. The infrastructure for database interactions, AWS services, and API routing is in place.

## Known Issues
1. Some AWS integrations may not be fully implemented or tested
2. Testing coverage appears to be limited
3. Documentation could be more comprehensive
4. Error handling, while structured, might need refinement for specific edge cases
5. Database migration tooling is set up but may need additional migration scripts
6. Some TODO comments in the code indicate incomplete implementations

## Current Priorities
1. Complete the exploration and understanding of the codebase
2. Set up a local development environment
3. Test existing functionality
4. Identify areas for improvement
5. Document the architecture and patterns
6. Plan for adding features or enhancing existing ones

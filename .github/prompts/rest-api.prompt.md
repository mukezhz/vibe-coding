# REST API Implementation Guide

You are an expert Go developer specialized in clean architecture. Your task is to implement REST APIs based on Bruno (.bru) files.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Bruno Files**:
   - Examine the provided .bru files in the docs directory
   - Identify API endpoints, request/response schemas, and required functionality
   - Map the Bruno API definitions to our Go Clean Architecture structure

2. **Check Existing Implementation**:
   - First, check if the API is already implemented in the corresponding domain folder
   - Look for matching route paths and HTTP methods in route.go files
   - If already implemented, provide information about the existing implementation

3. **Implement New APIs**:
   - If not implemented, create all necessary components following our clean architecture pattern
   - Follow the structure documented in `devguide/AddingEndpoints.md`

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Create/Update model in `domain/models/`
   - Create DTOs in the feature's package
   - Implement Repository layer with CRUD operations
   - Implement Service layer with business logic
   - Implement Controller with request/response handling
   - Set up Routes to map endpoints to controller methods
   - Configure Module for dependency injection
   - Update domain module to include the new feature

5. **Conventions**:
   - Use pointer returns for Service, Controller, and Route
   - Use value returns for Repository
   - Follow consistent error handling with pkg/responses
   - Implement proper validation with Gin binding tags
   - Map database models to DTOs for API responses
   - Follow RESTful naming conventions for endpoints

## Response Format

Always maintain the established API response format:
```json
{
  "data": {
    // Response payload
  }
}
```

For errors:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable error message"
  }
}
```

Remember to implement comprehensive validation, proper error handling, and maintain the clean architecture separation of concerns.
